Task 5.

The maximum number of nodes stored in BFTS is 1473871
The total number of nodes generated in BFTS is 2298274

The maximum number of nodes stored in BFGS is 1592
The total number of nodes generated in BFGS is 4359

The maximum number of nodes stored in DFGS is 14480
The total number of nodes generated in DFGS is 34266

DFTS runs until an OutOfMemory error appears. This we deduce that DFS using Tree Search entered a loop and will never find the solution.
